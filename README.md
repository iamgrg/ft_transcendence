# FT_Transcendence

## Overview

FT_Transcendence is a project that challenged our skills across multiple domains including web development, cybersecurity, user management, and more. This project involves creating a web-based application for playing the classic Pong game, enhanced with modern web technologies and security practices.

## Objectives

- Develop a web application to play Pong with multiplayer functionalities.
- Implement secure user authentication and management.
- Ensure the application adheres to modern cybersecurity standards.
- Utilize Docker to containerize and manage the application environment.

## Build Instructions

To set up the project environment and run the application:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Features

- Multiplayer Pong Game: Real-time Pong game capabilities with multiple players.
- User Authentication: Secure login systems with optional two-factor authentication.
- Cybersecurity Enhancements: Implementations of WAF/ModSecurity and secure handling of user data.
- Interactive User Interface: A responsive and intuitive user interface that supports dynamic interactions for gameplay.
- Persistent User Data: Management of user data and game statistics to enhance user experience.

## Security Measures
